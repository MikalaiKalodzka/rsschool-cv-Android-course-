_3. Summary:_
				My primary goal is to become Juniour Developer by the end of this year. I am interested in developing the 
				necessary set of skills in order to achive my goal. My main interest direction is mobile application 
				development. The reason why I am interested in this kind of development is simple: many times I have had
				to look for some application that could make easier certain aspect of my life. Unfortunately not
				always I had found exactly what I was looking for. Eventually an idea came to me that if I
				not able to find what I need than I should do it myself. But first of all I have to learn how to realize
				it.
